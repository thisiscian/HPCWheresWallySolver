  \section{Conclusion and Evaluation}
    Producing an implementation of parallel is not a simple task.

    \subsection{Evaluation}
      This project suffered from poor time management, coupled with an overestimation of how much work could be completed.
      This can, in part, be blamed upon lack of experience in project work like this.
