  Abstract = {This article presents a novel CPU-based parallel algorithm (P-SURF) that computes the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), a local descriptor that is able to find point correspondences between images in spite of scaling and rotation. The algorithm presented here parallelises all the seven major steps found in the original serial computation. The task in each of the steps is decomposed and the fractions are assigned to running threads bound onto distinctive processors. The implementation of the algorithm was tested using randomly selected images in regard to performance, scalability and stability. The results showed that its performance on mid-level Intel Core Duo processors was comparable to that of some fast GPU-based SURF implementations. For example, on a testing system equipped with an Intel Core Duo P8600 at 2.4 GHz, P-SURF was able to extract and represent features from a 640 Ã— 480 image at a rate of 33 frames per second. The experimental results also revealed that, instead of lea},

@article{floodfill,
Abstract = {Flood-filling of a region on raster devices is one of the most widely used techniques in the interactive graphical systems. Existing filling algorithms, in general, require significant amount of memory and/or are limited to the specific types of regions or fill styles. We discuss some of the up-to-date filling techniques and propose a general framework for generation of flood-filling algorithms. An ''optimal'' representative of this class of algorithms is presented. It is proved, in particular, that necessary size of work memory for this particular algorithm is proportional to the horizontal dimension of the box containing region to be filled. The algorithm may be used to fill 4-step and 8-step connected regions both border- and interior-defined.},
